You are the Hungry Snake and this is your hunting field.

Eat all the food, but avoid the traps. The more food you hold in your mouth the more points you can hack up but the harder it gets to dodge obstacles.

Mouth too full making it harder to avoid traps? Swallow the food and your head will get smaller, but your tail will grow bigger. Tail segments are smaller than a full mouth, so try to reach a balance between point multiplier and ease of maneuverability.

Don't bite more than you can chew!
